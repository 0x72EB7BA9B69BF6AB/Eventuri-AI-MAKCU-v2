CH340 (1A86:7523)

CH347 (1A86:5740)

CP2102 (10C4:EA60)

Custom class selection for different games (target what matters)

Fast aimbot with multiple modes: Normal, Bezier, Silent, Smooth/WindMouse

Profile system: save, load, and reset configs

Built with CustomTkinter for a polished, dark, responsive GUI

DirectML and CUDA 12.6 support (choose the best for your GPU)

Visual feedback for device connection, FPS, and AI status

⚡ Installation
NOTE:
CUDA support is only for NVIDIA GPUs, and only CUDA 12.6 is supported at this time. If you’re on AMD or Intel GPU, use DirectML mode.

1. Clone the repo
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/MAKCUAI/Eventuri-AI-MAKCU-v2
cd Eventuri-AI-MAKCU-v2
2. Setup for NVIDIA (CUDA 12.6 only)
Download and install CUDA 12.6:
[NVIDIA CUDA 12.6 Download](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.6.0/local_installers/cuda_12.6.0_560.76_windows.exe)

Run the CUDA installer and make sure everything is installed properly.

In this folder, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
install_setup_cuda.bat
When done, start the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
run_eventuri_ai.bat
3. Setup for DirectML (AMD/Intel/NVIDIA)
(No special driver install required.)

In this folder, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
install_setup_directml.bat
When done, start the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
run_eventuri_ai.bat
DirectML is easiest to install and works with most GPUs, but is typically 5–10% slower than CUDA.

🎮 Usage
Connect your device (see supported list below).

Start the app with one of the .bat launchers.

Select your AI model (.pt, .onnx, .engine) from the dropdown.

Configure detection/aim settings, select your classes/game targets.

Press START AIMBOT, change sensitivity to your in-game sens, hold your activation key, and you’re set.

❓ FAQ
Q: What YOLO versions does this support?
A: YOLOv8 to YOLOv12, in .pt, .onnx, and .engine formats.

Q: Can I use it for any game?
A: Yes—just select the correct model and target classes for your game in the GUI.

Q: Do I need NVIDIA?
A: No, you can use DirectML (for AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA). CUDA is just faster (NVIDIA only, CUDA 12.6 required).

Q: My device isn’t recognized.
A: Only the VID:PID list above is supported by default. For other hardware, ask in the issues.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
"CUDA not found":
Make sure you installed CUDA 12.6, not any other version.

App crashes or fails to load models:
Check your model file, device drivers, and dependencies.
